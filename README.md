FeelTrip is a real time content aggregator that enables users to stay connected to places beyond where they currently live. Unlike SnapChat, Twitter, Facebook, FeelTrip immerses users in the current mood of a given place, helping them either discover something new or reminisce in the now.


###Technical Overview & Approach

This application was built by 3 GA WDI students (in cooperation with Product Management Intensive students - and superstars - Julie Polizzotto, Judd Grutman, & Matthew Gibson) on a Node.js / Express / MongoDB stack + Semantic UI Front-end framework. For authentication, a JWT/Passport.js strategy is used, in addition to OAuth 1.0. The third party APIs we elected to use for this project were: Twitter, OpenWeather and Spotify. 


###User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to easily see all of the locations in one place so that I can make an informed decision about where I want to explore.

- As a user, I want to be able to view one location at a time so that I can feel immersed in the place (detailed view).

- As a user, I want to be able to view 5 - 15 trending topics on Twitter in a given place so that i can have an idea of what people care about in that moment in time without being too overwhelmed

- As a user, I want to be able to view the current weather of a given place so that i can envision myself there at that moment.

- As a user, I want to be able to return to the main view when I am on a locationâ€™s page so that i can immerse myself in other locations with minimal effort.
