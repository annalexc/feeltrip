**TECHNOLOGY**

The site is based on the node.js, express and MongoDB stack with a JavaScript front end. It uses authentication: jwt passport for the client side browser and for the server side it uses OAUTH 2.0. The site is based on the twitter api in the back-end - it pulls data from the openweathermap api and timezonedb api via AJAX calls in the front-end.

**GENERAL APPROACH**

This was a group project executed by 3 WDI developers (General Assembly in New York - bootcamp students - Anna, Kasia and Matt) in cooperation with a group of Project Managers (PMI students: Julie, Matt and Judd). The concept and software development took 1 week of hard work. Communication and cooperation was smooth and inspirational.

The biggest challenge in development was to generate the desired content from the twitter api. It was a great challenge as well as a valuable experience.
