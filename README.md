**TECHNOLOGY**
The site is based on node.js, express, MongoDB stack with the JavaScript front end. It uses authentication: jwt passport for the users part and for the server side it uses OAUTH 2.0. The site is based on twitter api in the back-end, as well as it uses data from openweathermap api and timezonedb api via AJAX calls in the front-end.

**GENERAL APPROACH**
It was a group project done by 3 WDI developers (General Assembly in New York - bootcamp students - Anna, Kasia and Matt) in cooperation with the group of Project Managers (PMI students) (Julie, Matt and Judd). The concept and software development took 1 week of hard work. Communication and cooperation was smooth and inspirational.

The biggest challenge in development was to generate the desired content from twitter api. It was a great challenge as well as a valuable experience.
